This directory contains code for FragmentCut, a method for the detection of long DNA fragments from dilution pool sequencing experiments. 

Input for FragmentCut: 

1. sorted BAM file for each pool 
2. reference fasta file (indexed) 
3. genome mappability file (fasta format) 
4. VCF file with heterozygous variants 


Output from FragmentCut: 

1. bedfile with list of fragment intervals
2. HapCUT formatted fragment file for haplotype assembly
